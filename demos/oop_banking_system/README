# C++ OOP Banking System

## Overview
This project is a simple banking system that demonstrates the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. The system allows users to manage a savings account by performing deposits, withdrawals, and applying interest to the balance.

## Features
- **Encapsulation:** Secure class data using private members.
- **Inheritance:** The `SavingsAccount` class inherits from the base `Account` class.
- **Polymorphism:** Potential for method overriding in derived classes.
- **Account Management:** Perform deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cpp-oop-banking-system
```

3. Compile and run the project:
